The history
of bullets
far predates the history
of
firearms Originally bullets
were metallic stone or
purposemade clay balls used as
sling ammunition as weapons and for
hunting
Eventually as firearms were developed these same items were placed in front
of a
propellant charge of gunpowder at the end of a
closed tube As firearms became more technologically
advanced from  to
 bullets changed very
little They
remained
simple round
spherical
lead
balls called
rounds
differing only in their diameter  
     Matchlock
musket balls
alleged to have been discovered at Naseby battlefield From the collection of
Night of the Museum and Art
Gallery 
The
development of
the hand culverin and
matchlock arquebus brought about the use of cast lead balls
as projectiles Bullet is derived
from the
French word
boulette
which
roughly
means little
ball The original musket bullet was a spherical lead ball smaller than the bore
wrapped in a loosely fitted paper patch
which served to hold the bullet
in the
barrel firmly upon the
powder Bullets that were not firmly upon the powder upon firing
risked causing the barrel
to explode
with the condition
known
as a short
start The loading of muskets was therefore easy with
the old
smoothbore Brown Bess
and similar military muskets The
original muzzleloading
rifle on the other hand with a more
closely
fitting ball to take the
rifling grooves was more difficult to load particularly when the
bore of
the barrel was
fouled from previous firings
For
this reason early rifles were not
generally
used for military purposes 
The first
half of
the nineteenth century saw a
distinct change
in the shape and function of the bullet
In 
Delvigne a French infantry
officer
invented a breech with
abrupt shoulders
on which
a spherical bullet was rammed
down until it
caught the rifling grooves Delvignes method however
deformed the bullet
and was inaccurate
